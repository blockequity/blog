I"Ë<p>How many barcodes do you see each day? The number would probably be in the hundreds if you actively paid attention as the majority of all consumer products carry a UPC barcode that carries the brand, name, manufacturer, and other pertienent info about the product at hand. Barcodes were originally invented around the permise of Morse code and was extended to thin and thick bars, which makes reading the information encoded mushc easier for machines.</p>
