This essay strives to be an easy to understand living guide as it relates to the concept of blockchains. From the birth of the idea, its rapid growth in the developer ecosystem and soon its permeation into everyday society and culture.

The blockchain concept was introduced in a research paper in 1982 by David Chaum titled “Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups” or in other words “how do we trust internet strangers?”. Then nine years later in 1991, Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta wanted to create a system where a [document’s timestamp](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.46.8740) couldn’t be tampered with. It wasn’t until Dave Byer arrived in 1992 and the trio incorporated [Merkle Trees](https://www.blockequity.com/define) into the design thereby improving it’s efficiency.

It wasn’t until January 3rd, 2009 a Saturday, when an anonymous person and/or group of people calling themselves/himself/herself Satoshi Nakamoto and mined block #0 of the Bitcoin blockchain. Not only did Satoshi receive 50 bitcoins as a reward for mining a bitcoin block, but they also left a cryptic message in the [coinbase](https://www.blockequity.com/define) of said first block - announcing “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks”.
